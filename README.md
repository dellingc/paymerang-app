## Paymerang App

This application displays the data retrieved from the [Paymerang API](https://github.com/dellingc/Paymerang-API). It makes a GET request to the API and recieves the JSON object containing all of the payment information. 

## Instructions
Click this [link](https://github.com/dellingc/Paymerang-API) to get the API setup. Follow readme instructions.

Once the API is setup and running. Open a second terminal.
Clone the repository and install node packages
```
git clone https://github.com/dellingc/paymerang-app.git
cd paymerang-app
npm install
npm run start
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter this error `Error: Cannot find module 'nan’` when attempting `npm install` follow the steps below.

```
npm install nan
npm install
```
The app is configured to run at http://localhost:3000, this may need to be changed in your local environment. The Paymerang API server must be running in order to recieve the data to display.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
